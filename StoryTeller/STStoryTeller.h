 The main StoryTeller class.
 @discussion This class brings together all the configuration and processing for Story Teller. At the moment it's all in one class because it's not very big. Most of the functionality commonly needed is wrapped up in macros defined above.
 
 Story teller starts up as a singleton when the app loads. At that time it reads it's configuration and sets itself with default value. From that point on it can be accessed through the storyTeller access point.

 Starts a key Scope. 

 @discussion the Key will basically group any `STLog(...)` statements that occur after it's definition and until it goes out of scope. Scope follows the Objective-C scope rules in that it finishes at the end of the current function, loop or if statement. Basically when a locally declared variable would be dealloced.
 
 The major difference is that this scope also applies to any `STLog(...)` statements that are contained within methods called whilst the scope is active. This is the main purpose of this as it allows methods which do not have access to the key to be included in the logs when that key is being logged.
