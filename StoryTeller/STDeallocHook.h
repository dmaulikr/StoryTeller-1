NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

/**
 Simple class that is designed to execute a block when a variable goes out of scope.
 
 @discussion To use it, do something like the following

    id hook = [[STDeallocHook alloc] initWithBlock:^{
	    // Do something when 'hook' is dealloced
    }];

 When `hook` goes out of scope and is deallocated, the code block will be executed. In Story Teller, STDeallocHook is used to detect when a `startScope(...)` macro should end the scope of the key. The hook simply calls endScope:.
