# StoryTeller 

*A log should tell a story, not drown the reader in irrelevance* 

Story Teller is an advanced logging framework that takes an entirely different approach to logging - swapping the limitations of severity levels for smart active search criteria.

See how it works on the main [Story Teller site](http://drekka.github.io/StoryTeller).
