NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

/**
 Simple class that is designed to execute a block when a variable goes out of scope.

 @discussion To use it, do something like the following

				id hook = [[STDeallocHook alloc] initWithBlock:^{
					// Do something when 'hook' is dealloced
				}];

 When `hook` goes out of scope and is deallocated, the code block will be executed. STDeallocHook is used to detect when a `STStartScope(...)` macro should end the scope of the key. The `STStartScope(...)` macro declares a local variable with a unique name and sets a STDeallocHook as it's value. When the hook deallocs, it calls endScope: in Story Teller and tells it to remove the key from the active list.
